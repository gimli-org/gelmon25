## About

The [7<sup>th</sup> international workshop on geoelectrical monitoring (GELMON 2025)][gelmon] will be held in Vienna February 17<sup>th</sup> - 20<sup>th</sup> 2025.
This will include a pyGIMLi workshop on open-source and versatile processing and time-lapse inversion of geoelectrical monitoring data.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that this repository currently serves as a placeholder. More information on the workshop content including slides and Jupyter Notebooks are currently being prepared and will be made available here in early 2025.

As preparation, you might want to have a look at the existing tutorials from SWUNG meetings and SEG webinars:
* [Transform 2021](https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2021): Geophysical modelling & inversion with pyGIMLi I
* [Transform 2022](https://github.com/gimli-org/transform2022): Geophysical modelling & inversion with pyGIMLi II
* [SEG Webinar 2024](https://github.com/gimli-org/SEGwebinar): pyGIMLi - Open-source Research & Teaching Software

all of them accompagnied with Youtube videos and Jupyter Notebooks.
